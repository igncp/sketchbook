# Sketchbook

Project sketches. The sketches consist in diagrams about the source code of popular or interesting projects. It uses [this library](https://github.com/igncp/diagrams-collection), built on top of D3.js, to render the diagrams. The projects may change as there are directories (`discontinued` and `hidden`) that are not tracked by git.

## Complete installation

- `make install` (GNU Make, Ruby, Node and NPM required)

## Local usage

- `npm serve` to serve the application, using 8080 by default
- `npm build-dev` To compile the javascript and styles


## Development

It assumes that you have the repository `diagrams-collection` at the same level as `sketchbook`
