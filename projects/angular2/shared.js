  "class-LifeCycle": "Provides access to explicitly trigger change detection in an application. By default, `Zone` triggers change detection in Angular on each virtual machine (VM) turn. When testing, or in some limited application use cases, a developer can also trigger change detection with the `lifecycle.tick()` method. Each Angular application has a single `LifeCycle` instance."
